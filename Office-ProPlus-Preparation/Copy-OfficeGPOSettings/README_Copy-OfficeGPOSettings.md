### Copy Office GPO Settings
Automate the process of moving from an existing version of Office to a newer version while retaining the current set of group policies. 

**IT Pro Scenario:** Organizations that are upgrading Office to 2016 and would like to maintain their settings through the move should use this script. This will automate the update of group policies without requiring IT to manually rebuild them post upgrade.
