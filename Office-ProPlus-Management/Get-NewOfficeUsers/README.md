### Get New Office Users
This script will identify licensed Office 365 users and track the dates they were enabled or disabled. The second part of this is a guide that walks the user through setting up a scheduled task to send welcome emails with training material to new Office users. 

**IT Pro Scenario:** Organizations that want to provide informational/training emails to provide end users with tools to succeed post deployment. Many times IT is focused on the deployment and don't focus on adoption. This is a way to automate several welcome scripts post deployment to end users that will provide them with links to training material.
