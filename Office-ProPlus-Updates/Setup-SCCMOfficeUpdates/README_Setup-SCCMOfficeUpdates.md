### Setup SCCM Office Updates
Configures System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) to configure Office Click-To-Run clients to use their closest Distribution Point (DP) for Office Updates.

**IT Pro Scenario:** For organizations that are looking to deploy office updates in a managed environment ensuring that users are using the closest Distribution Point. This will help to limit the bandwidth costs associated with pushing updates and is only useful for environments with more than one Distribution Point.
