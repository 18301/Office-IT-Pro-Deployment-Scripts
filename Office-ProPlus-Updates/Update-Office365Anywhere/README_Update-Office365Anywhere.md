### Update Office 365 Anywhere
This function is designed to provide way for Office Click-To-Run clients to have the ability to update themselves from a managed network source or from the Internet depending on the availability of the primary update source. The idea behind this is if users have laptops and are mobile they may not receive updates if they are not able to be in the office on regular basis.
